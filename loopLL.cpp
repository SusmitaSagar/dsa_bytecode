//Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm : Move one pointer(slow_p) by one and another pointer(fast_p) by two.
//If these pointers meet at the same node then there is a loop. If pointers do not meet then linked list doesn’t have a loop.

//see a visited node again then there is a loop. O(n) 
//using a hash, just store the addresses of visited nodes in a hash and if you see an address that already exists in hash then there is a loop.
